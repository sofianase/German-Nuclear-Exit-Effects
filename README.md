# German-Nuclear-Exit-Effects
This research proposal looks into the potential health effects as a result of the domino reaction to Atomausstig, Germany's plan to close down nuclear reactors as sources of energy.

## Overview
As Germany decided to close out all of their nuclear reactors by the end of 2023, this paper was motivated by the expected chain effects that result in the country seeking their energy from other sources to make up for the missing energy to their grid. 

## Research Question
What are the effects of Germany’s 2023 nuclear phase-out on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalization outcomes attributable to air pollution? 

## Hypothesized Causal Chain
The expected chain of effects goes as follows:
Closure of nuclear power plants 
-> increased of burning fossil fuels 
-> increased air pollution 
-> increased related health 

## Proposed Methods
- Quasi-experimental policy analysis
- Differences-in-differences and regional comparisons
- Combining energy production, air quality, and health outcome data
- Sensitity analysis to account for differences across regions

## Proposed Data Sources
- German energy production statistics
- Regional air quality monitoring data
- Public hospitalization records
- Socioeconomic and demographic control variables

## Collaboration
This proposal was developed in collaboration with **Taliah Smith (Georgia Institute of Technology)**.

## Status
Research proposal
No restricted or confidential data included.
